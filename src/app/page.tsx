      Welcome to KLM Labs, my personal playground.
      <span className="block text-3xl font-normal mt-2 leading-relaxed">
        Here you’ll find an evolving collection of my work — spanning web and app development, health tech experiments, photography, music, and more. I’m constantly tinkering with new ideas, from turning personal health data into actionable insights to capturing life’s moments through sound and image. My goal? To be good at everything, or at least try to be.
